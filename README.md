Controls for games I play on a Mac using [GamePad Companion](http://www.carvware.com) + an XBOX 360 controller


I looked all over the internet for a half decent list of controls for different games. This doesn't seem to exist so I'm doing it myself one game at a time.

As an aside I find GamePad Companion to be a woefully designed product but it does seem to be the only thing on the market that does what it er, does.
